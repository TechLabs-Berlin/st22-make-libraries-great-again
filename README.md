# st22-make-libraries-great-again
Make Libraries Great Again is a project for making Berlin Public Libraries more user friendly and interactive. Aim is to create a concept so that libraries don't only consist of books, but rather things that society may need, such games, musical, some other social activities (so called Library of Things).
