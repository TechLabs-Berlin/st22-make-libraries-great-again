## Summary for "Make Libraries Great Again" ##

“MLGA” is based on the vision to make libraries more attractive for a younger and more tech-savvy audience by showcasing the varied services available at modern libraries, including book/e-book/audiobook rental, library of things, events, workspaces and much more.
As a first step to this end, our project aimed to build a landing page for library users that contains a recommender system in a user interface with multiple carousels (cf. Netflix) to achieve a more interactive experience. 
While the prototype is limited to a recommender based on similarity between books, we envisioned additional carousels that make recommendations based on a chosen genre, recommendations by library staff, etc.
The complete website would also include a library search function to look for a specific book, upcoming events, suitable workspace and similar features.
